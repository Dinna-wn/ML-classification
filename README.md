comparison of classification models

The goal of this work is to analyze and critique the performance of some classification algorithms: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Bagging, AdaBoost, Naive Bayesian Classification. 

Data:

To perform this comparison, we need to work with datasets collected from Twitter that represent two categories of users: polluting users (Content Polluters class) 
and "normal/legitimate" users (Legitimate Users class). Mainly, the data we need to analyze contains 2,353,473 tweets posted by 
22,223 malicious users (content polluters). And 3 259 693 tweets posted by 19 276 legitimate users.
